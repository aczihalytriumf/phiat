Standard Analysis Procedure
========

1). Fit shorter Tacc files to determine potential cyclotron frequencies of
    unknown species
    
2). Once species identified, use higher Tacc files to find proper cyclotron
      frequency of species/ions of interest
    
3). Find cyclotron frequency of calibrant ion (separately taken data)
    
4). Determine mass excess from interest/calibrant ion frequencies using
      `freq_to_mass_converter.m`

Analysis Procedure Step 1
-----

- Determine possible cyclotron frequencies of all spots in files with
  (relatively) shorter Tacc
  
- These Tacc are typically chosen arbitrarily, such that a certain species will
  NOT always end up at the same phase
  
- This is critical, as it would be impossible to identify species via cyclotron frequencies if
  their spots were at the same phase across a set of files
  
- This is done via Create Freq ID and identifying common frequencies
  across files
  
- NOTE: Here, use frequencies derived from AME as guess frequencies based on what is
  expected in the beam (`TITAN-spreadsheet.xlsx` will be helpful, see end for more details)

Analysis Procedure Step 2
-----

- These files will have Taccs chosen such that the ion of interest should be at similar angles close
  to the reference spot angle FOR ALL FILES
  
- The guess frequency here will be the frequency of the ion of interest
  species as determined in step 1
  
- The results of the sinusoid fit constitute the “final” cyclotron frequency for
  the ion of interest

Analysis Procedure Step 3
-----

- The cyclotron frequency of a calibrant ion is determined using the same
prescription as step 2

- Since calibrants are precisely known, the guess frequency can be derived
from AME as in step 1
